## How It Works

1. **During Gameplay**: The system tracks all your actions:
   - Ingredient selection patterns
   - Tool usage frequency
   - Order completion times
   - Mistakes and their types
   - Stress level changes

2. **AI Analysis**: When you view the report:
   - Statistics are calculated from tracked data
   - Grades are assigned based on performance thresholds
   - AI generates contextual text based on your specific stats
   - Multiple AI prompts are sent to get different perspectives

3. **Fallback System**: If AI is unavailable:
   - Pre-written contextual messages are used
   - Still fully functional with all stats and grades
   - Seamless experience either way
